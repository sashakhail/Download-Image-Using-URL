# Download-Image-Using-URL  
An Android App which download an image from a URL address.   
As soon as App starts, it will start an AsyncTask class to begin downloading an image from a URL address in Main Activity itself and when download completes, it stops Progress Bar and Image will be displayed.  
If it is helpful to you then follow me (you can give it a star too), I will make some more useful standard codes..  
Happy Coding :)
